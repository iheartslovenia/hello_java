### Is this right? ###

I am not good with GitHub. I am not good with Java. Please tell me what to do next.

I want to make a "Hello World" program with Java. Is this right? If not, tell me how to fix it. Tell me what to do next in GitHub, as well.
Thank you. ðŸ˜„

## Hello Java World ##
//Here is some code and this is a comment.

class HelloJava {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' (I hope)
    */

   public static main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
}
